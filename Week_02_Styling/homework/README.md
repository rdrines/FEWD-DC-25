#FEWD Week #2: Styling with CSS


###Description


A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, has approached you to help them develop a new landing page for their company. They've handed you the [design file](starter_code/design_file.txt) for the site, along with the copy and assets. You need to take these files and turn it into a landing page.

###Real-World Applications


- Build a website from a [design file](starter_code/design_file.txt)
- Integrate advanced CSS properties
- Use HTML5 structural elements
- Use CSS Resets to "normalize" the rendering of your page across different browsers
- Use the Box Model to style element borders and structure your page


###Technical Requirements

- Use HTML5 structural elements (nav, header, footer)
- Use a CSS Reset file in addition to your style.css file to style the page
- Use IDs and Classes to to select and style elements on the page
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across .html and .css files and use best practices for naming IDs and Classes
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability
- Use CSS display and float to get the layout correct
